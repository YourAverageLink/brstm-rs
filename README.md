# brstm

crate to read and modify .brstm adpcm files found in nintendo games

The main reason this was created, was to allow duplicating tracks in a song since Skyward Sword is stupid and doesn't loop the song otherwise.

It's possible to get the PCM data from a track and encode PCM data into ADPCM.
